Guide for implementing cron jobs in Ubuntu to perform automatic tasks. It assumes you have cloned the Game repository to /opt/Game and recursively set file permissions to 777.





The following is for automated game database backups that occur every 3 hours:


sudo su (become root user)

crontab -e (will prompt for editor choice, I like nano so I pick 1)

Example usage, providing you have cloned the Game repo to /opt/Web with recursive 777 file permissions:

0 */3 * * * make -C /opt/Web backup-openrsc
0 */3 * * * make -C /opt/Web backup-cabbage
0 23 * * * make -C /opt/Web clear-old-backups





Make sure you have edited "/opt/Game/.env" with the database (openrsc/cabbage/etc) as well as your
created MariaDB SQL user and password. The make command refers to a Makefile in the Game directory that
reads environment variables from the hidden .env file in the Game directory.

You can test out crontab scheduling using: https://crontab.guru

If successful, a zip file should appear in the "/opt/Game/data" directory. Example:

root@MariaDB:/opt/Game/data# ls -ls
total 15020
15016 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 15373449 Mar  7 22:11 20190307-2211-EST.zip
    4 drwxrwxrwx 3 root root     4096 Mar  2 11:35 db





For clearing out database backups older than 7 days (these will grow in size over time and eventually use the entire disk otherwise):
0 23 * * * make -C /opt/Game clear-old-backups

“At 23:00.”

To perform a nightly renewal check for Lets Encrypt SSL certs, providing you have cloned the Game repo to /opt/Web with recursive 777 file permissions:

0 23 * * * cd /opt/Web && certbot certonly --standalone --preferred-challenges http --agree-tos -n --config-dir ./etc/letsencrypt --pre-hook 'sudo docker stop nginx' --post-hook 'sudo docker start nginx' -d openrsc.com -d game.openrsc.com -d cabbage.openrsc.com -d dev.openrsc.com -d web.openrsc.com -d androidcheck.openrsc.com --expand -m YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com > /opt/Web/certbot-renewal.log





If the server config is set to shutdown the game server at a specified hour and minute each day, use the following corresponding cron job to start the server back up:

1 0 * * * make -C /opt/OpenRSC run-game
1 0 * * * make -C /opt/Cabbage run-game
1 0 * * * make -C /opt/Preservation run-game
1 0 * * * make -C /opt/OpenPK run-game
